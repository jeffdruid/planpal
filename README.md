### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is used to build the server-side functionality of the Social Event Planner, including handling HTTP requests, database operations, and user authentication.

### SQLite
Django's built-in SQLite is used as the database for this project. It is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process, making it easy to set up and use.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

### jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation, making it easier to develop dynamic and interactive web pages.

### FullCalendar
FullCalendar is a JavaScript calendar library for creating interactive and customizable calendars. It is used to display events in a calendar view, allowing users to see their schedules at a glance.

### Google Places API
The Google Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. It is used to enhance event location input by providing autocomplete functionality and additional place details.

### Font Awesome
Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and LESS. It is used to add scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS.

### Ajax
Ajax is used to perform asynchronous HTTP requests to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. It enhances the user experience by providing faster and more dynamic interactions.

### Tippy.js

### Moment.js
Moment.js is a JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times. It is used in conjunction with FullCalendar to handle date and time formatting.

### Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It is used to deploy and host the Social Event Planner web application.

### SendGrid

## Troubleshooting
- Password Reset: Users can reset their password via email if they forget it.
   - ~~The password reset functionality is implemented using Django's built-in password reset views and templates. Users can request a password reset by entering their email address, and an email with a reset link will be sent to them. The link contains a unique token that allows users to set a new password. The password reset link is valid for a limited time and can only be used once.~~
   - This feature was replaced with an one time link sent to the user's email to reset their password.

## Testing
All testing was done manually and automated using Django's built-in testing framework. The application was tested for functionality, user experience, and security. Test cases were created to cover user stories and edge cases, ensuring the application works as expected.
<!-- TODO - Add link to test cases -->

### Test Cases

#### Accounts App:

- Dashboard View: Ensures the dashboard loads correctly and displays the correct information.
- Signup View: Verifies that the signup process works correctly.
- Profile View: Confirms the profile view loads and updates correctly.
- Friends Page View: Checks that the friends page loads correctly.
- Send Friend Request: Ensures friend requests can be sent.
- Respond Friend Request: Validates the process of responding to a friend request.
- Delete Friend: Tests the deletion of friends.
- One-Time Login Link:
   - Sending the one-time login link.
   - Logging in using the one-time login link.
   - Handling expired tokens.
   - Ensuring invalid user IDs are handled gracefully.

#### Invitations App:

- Manage Invitations View: Verifies that event creators can manage invitations.
- Create Invitation View: Ensures event creators can invite friends and handle various scenarios (e.g., no friends, non-friends, duplicate invitations).

#### Notifications App:

- Notifications View: Ensures the notifications view loads correctly.
- Mark Notification Read: Confirms notifications can be marked as read and the correct redirection occurs.
- Get Notifications: Verifies that unread notifications are fetched correctly.

##### Example Test Cases
Here's an example of a test case for the one-time login link:

```python
def test_send_one_time_login_link(self):
    """Test to ensure the one-time login link is sent to the correct email."""
    print("Testing send one-time login link...")
    response = self.client.post(
        reverse("send_one_time_login_link_form"),
        {"email": self.user.email},
    )
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
    self.assertEqual(len(mail.outbox), 1)
    self.assertIn("Your one-time login link for PlanPal", mail.outbox[0].subject)
    print("Send one-time login link tested successfully.")
```

- The test case sends a POST request to the `send_one_time_login_link_form` view with the user's email address.
- It checks that the response status code is 302 (redirect) and that an email is sent.
- The test asserts that the email subject contains the expected text.
- The test case is run as part of the test suite to ensure the one-time login link functionality works as expected.

### Validator Testing
TODO - Add validator screenshots
#### flake8
- Flake8 is a Python linting tool that checks the codebase for style and syntax errors.

#### CI Python Linter

### Manual Testing
- Manual testing is performed to verify the functionality of the application from a user's perspective.

## Bugs

## UI Improvements

## Future Improvements

#### Google Maps JavaScript API
- The Google Maps JavaScript API would be used to embed maps into the web pages and provide location-based services, such as displaying event locations on a map.

#### Dynamic Data Integration
- Real-Time Data Updates: Data on the dashboard, calendar, and event responses could be updated in real-time using WebSockets or other technologies.

#### Filtering and Sorting
- Enhanced Filtering: Users could filter events based on criteria such as date, location, or event type.
