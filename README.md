## Technologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)

### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is used to build the server-side functionality of the Social Event Planner, including handling HTTP requests, database operations, and user authentication.

### SQLite
Django's built-in SQLite is used as the database for this project. It is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process, making it easy to set up and use.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

### jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation, making it easier to develop dynamic and interactive web pages.

### FullCalendar
FullCalendar is a JavaScript calendar library for creating interactive and customizable calendars. It is used to display events in a calendar view, allowing users to see their schedules at a glance.

### Google Places API
The Google Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. It is used to enhance event location input by providing autocomplete functionality and additional place details.

### Font Awesome
Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and LESS. It is used to add scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS.

### Ajax
Ajax is used to perform asynchronous HTTP requests to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. It enhances the user experience by providing faster and more dynamic interactions.

### Tippy.js
Tippy.js is a lightweight, highly customizable tooltip and popover library. It is used to display additional information about events when users hover over them in the calendar.

### Moment.js
Moment.js is a JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times. It is used in conjunction with FullCalendar to handle date and time formatting.

### Google Maps JavaScript API
The Google Maps JavaScript API is used to embed maps into the web pages and provide location-based services, such as displaying event locations on a map.
