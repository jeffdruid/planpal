## Troubleshooting
- Password Reset: Users can reset their password via email if they forget it.
   - ~~The password reset functionality is implemented using Django's built-in password reset views and templates. Users can request a password reset by entering their email address, and an email with a reset link will be sent to them. The link contains a unique token that allows users to set a new password. The password reset link is valid for a limited time and can only be used once.~~
   ![password reset](README/images/feat-reset-disabled.png)
   - This feature was replaced with an one time link sent to the user's email to reset their password.

### Test Cases
- Unit tests were created to cover the core functionality of the application, including user authentication, event creation, invitations, notifications, and friend management. The tests ensure that the application works as expected and that new features do not introduce regressions.
![test cases](README/images/test-unit-tests.png)

#### Accounts App:

- Dashboard View: Ensures the dashboard loads correctly and displays the correct information.
- Signup View: Verifies that the signup process works correctly.
- Profile View: Confirms the profile view loads and updates correctly.
- Friends Page View: Checks that the friends page loads correctly.
- Send Friend Request: Ensures friend requests can be sent.
- Respond Friend Request: Validates the process of responding to a friend request.
- Delete Friend: Tests the deletion of friends.
- One-Time Login Link:
   - Sending the one-time login link.
   - Logging in using the one-time login link.
   - Handling expired tokens.
   - Ensuring invalid user IDs are handled gracefully.

#### Invitations App:

- Manage Invitations View: Verifies that event creators can manage invitations.
- Create Invitation View: Ensures event creators can invite friends and handle various scenarios (e.g., no friends, non-friends, duplicate invitations).

#### Notifications App:

- Notifications View: Ensures the notifications view loads correctly.
- Mark Notification Read: Confirms notifications can be marked as read and the correct redirection occurs.
- Get Notifications: Verifies that unread notifications are fetched correctly.

##### Example Test Cases
Here's an example of a test case for the one-time login link:

```python
def test_send_one_time_login_link(self):
    """Test to ensure the one-time login link is sent to the correct email."""
    print("Testing send one-time login link...")
    response = self.client.post(
        reverse("send_one_time_login_link_form"),
        {"email": self.user.email},
    )
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
    self.assertEqual(len(mail.outbox), 1)
    self.assertIn("Your one-time login link for PlanPal", mail.outbox[0].subject)
    print("Send one-time login link tested successfully.")
```

- The test case sends a POST request to the `send_one_time_login_link_form` view with the user's email address.
- It checks that the response status code is 302 (redirect) and that an email is sent.
- The test asserts that the email subject contains the expected text.
- The test case is run as part of the test suite to ensure the one-time login link functionality works as expected.
